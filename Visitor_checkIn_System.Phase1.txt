Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Project: Visitor Check-In System for Offices

1. Requirement Gathering

Currently, many offices rely on manual paper registers or spreadsheets to track visitor check-ins and check-outs.
Receptionists record details manually, which often leads to errors, missing information, and delays in notifying
employees when their guests arrive. Requirements gathered from stakeholders include:

Simple check-in form for receptionists
 Automatic notification to host employees
Ability to log check-in and check-out times
A digital record for security purposes
Reports and dashboards to analyze visitor trends

2. Stakeholder Analysis

Receptionist: Needs an easy system to log visitor details quickly.
Visitors: Expect a smooth check-in process without delays.
Host Employee: Should receive immediate notification when their visitor arrives.
HR/Security Team: Require accurate visitor history for audits and security compliance.
 Management: Wants insights into visitor patterns for resource planning.

3. Business Process Mapping

Current Process (Manual): Visitor arrives → Receptionist writes details in a paper register → Receptionist calls the
 host → Data remains scattered in registers → Difficult to track trends.
Proposed Process (Salesforce App): Visitor arrives → Receptionist logs details into Salesforce form → System 
auto-notifies host employee → Visitor’s check-in/out stored digitally → Reports and dashboards provide real-time insights.

4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

In industries like IT services, consulting, and manufacturing, visitor tracking is critical for security and compliance.
 Offices often face challenges in managing visitor logs efficiently. Larger organizations use expensive visitor management
 software, but smaller offices require a lightweight, cost-effective, and easy-to-use solution—something Salesforce can
 deliver quickly with minimal customization.

5. AppExchange Exploration

A search on Salesforce AppExchange shows apps like CHECK-in and Visitor Management solutions. These apps often include
 advanced features such as QR codes, badge printing, and mobile integration. However, these may be too complex or costly
 for small offices. This project focuses on building a simpler, custom Salesforce solution with only essential
 features: check-in/out logging, notifications, and basic dashboards.
